# Global Invasive Species Information Network (GISIN) protocol for invasive species information

This is the original version of the three implemented data models for invasive species hosted at http://www.gisin.org:

* `SpeciesStatus`: http://www.gisin.org/GISIN/SpeciesStatus_4_0_0.xsd
* `Occurrence`: http://www.gisin.org/GISIN/Occurrence_4_0_0.xsd
* `SpeciesResourceURL`: http://www.gisin.org/GISIN/SpeciesResourceURL_4_0_0.xsd

It includes version 2.0 of the GISIN protocol specification, last updated on 2008-06-15, from http://ibis-live1.nrel.colostate.edu/cwis438/websites/GISINDirectory/Tech/ProtocolSpecification.php?WebSiteID=4. The index.html that is included is a copy from the website cleaned for formatting, but not reviewed for content.
